## What is R?
R is a programing language that specializes in statistical analysis and the plotting of data. Written mostly in C and in R itself, it first appeared in 1993. It is free and open source, and is a top choice for data scientists and academic researchers, and also popular in newsrooms. Developers have created a rich repository of "packages" for R, which create new funtionality and even a different way of writing code than Base R. These packages have expanded R's usability to include things like data scrapping, textual analysis, and interactive graphics.
